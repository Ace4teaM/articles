            <p>This HTML Code Tutorial will teach you the fundamentals you need to create a website with HTML.
            We will focus on showing you how to use as little HTML code as possible when building web pages and then to format your web page using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets )
            This HTML tutorial covers the mechanical side of simple web page building from the basic HTML tag, all the way to uploading your pages to the internet. Even includes a free FTP tool and instructions for putting your website on the internet.
            Lessons cover HTML codes for header tags, paragraphs, lists, hyperlinks, tables , frames, forms and more.
            </p>
            <p>
            CSS
            The simple lessons also teach the art of formatting pages and text using CSS compliant Style Sheets.
            Please visit our CSS Demo that shows the importance of learning CSS as you learn HTML. 
            Note: Every web page in this demo was created with the same exact HTML code, but using a different style sheet.
            You can Download the Kit in a zip file for further studies.

            Choosing an Editor
            I don't recommend any WYSIWYG editor for building websites. I don't care who made it, Microsoft, Mozilla, Adobe or any other software provider, if it's WYSIWYG it's JUNK!
            If you paid $1400 for a Visual or WYSIWYG, you still need to learn HTML code, just to fix the problems your editor will create.
            If you want to use a WYSIWYG, learn to build web pages with a simple text or HTML editor first. Then you'll be equipped to fix the CRAP your WYSIWYG generates!
            Most WYSIWYGs are harder to learn to use than it is to learn HTML code. So why waste the effort?
